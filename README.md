Craigslist Highlighter
=======================

A greasemonkey script to make scanning craiglist for apartments easier. 

(Note: If you are viewing this in FF with greasemonkey enabled, in order to actually look at the source of the .user.js file, you have to turn off greasemonkey temporarily.)

**So what does it do?**

At the moment, it should turn [this listing page](http://i.imgur.com/z5UVY.jpg) into [something like this](http://i.imgur.com/Lg3E0.jpg), and [this item page](http://i.imgur.com/9zbqA.jpg) into [something like this](http://i.imgur.com/78gq6.jpg).

It makes it easier to narrow attention down to the more interesting ones, but there's still a fair way to go before I'm happy with it.

**Next steps:**

* fix urls to activate on to not be city-specific
* Set up an easy way to install it. Write instructions.
* Create an easy way to add and remove to each of the lists.
* Look into making it a bit more general so it can apply to more/most areas of craigslist
