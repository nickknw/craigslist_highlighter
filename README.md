Greasemonkey script. (Note: If you are viewing this with Greasemonkey enabled, in order to actually look at the source, you have to turn off Greasemonkey temporarily.)

At the moment, it should turn [this listing page](http://i.imgur.com/z5UVY.jpg) into [something like this](http://i.imgur.com/Lg3E0.jpg), and [this item page](http://i.imgur.com/9zbqA.jpg) into [something like this](http://i.imgur.com/78gq6.jpg).

Still a fair way to go before I'm happy with it though.

Next steps:

* fix urls to activate on to not be city-specific
* Set up an easy way to install it. Write instructions.
* Create an easy way to add and remove to each of the lists.
* Look into making it a bit more general so it can apply to more/most areas of craigslist
